# Data-Mining BMI Estimation Based Circumference Measurements

This was the datamining course project at LAU in which, using a dataset provided by Dr. Rasha Boulos, several models were used to estimate the body mass index based on some bodily circumference measurements. So in case you get stuck on an island with nothing other than a measuring tape (let's hope not). You can use the models trained here. Enjoy :)
